<h1>About Me </h1>

<hr/>
<p>
I am a passionate System Developer with a strong interest in problem-solving, technology, and building sustainable digital solutions.
With a background that combines system development and business administration, I bring a unique perspective that bridges technical
requirements with real business needs.
</p>

<p>
I currently work as a System Developer and Scrum Master at Statistics Sweden (SCB), where I am part of a cross-functional agile team.
My work focuses on developing, maintaining, and managing systems that handle large volumes of data, where accuracy, performance,
and reliability are critical. I have hands-on experience with technologies such as C#, .NET, SQL, Git, Azure DevOps, and Visual Studio.
</p>

<p>
My experience in agile methodologies, especially Scrum, allows me to contribute not only as a developer but also as a facilitator who
supports effective collaboration, clear communication, and continuous improvement within the team.
</p>

<p>
In addition to my technical background, I have extensive experience in administration, HR-related roles, coaching, and support.
This has strengthened my communication skills, user-focused mindset, and ability to understand people, processes, and organizational goals.
I am comfortable working with stakeholders, supporting users, and translating requirements into practical technical solutions.
</p>

<p>
I am a motivated and curious developer who values quality, learning, and collaboration. I am looking for opportunities where I can continue
to grow as an IT professional, contribute to meaningful projects, and create solutions that make a real difference.
